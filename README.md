# ChatApplication
Overview:
In this project, we will create a simple chat application that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. The application will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, and PHP will be used for server-side 
processing to handle messages and user interactions.

Features:
1. User Registration and Login: Users will be able to register and log in to the chat application using their email and password. 
2. Real-Time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real-time with other online users.
3. User-friendly Interface: The application will have an intuitive and responsive user interface for smooth user interactions.

Technologies Used:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using AJAX for real-time messaging)

Back-end: PHP, MySQL (to store user data and chat history)
